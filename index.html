                    My name is Sandhya Pradeshik. I currently live in West Cary. Moved down here four years ago. I like this RTP area so far.
                    I have lived in many different states including tri-state area. I have done Bachelors in Business Administration/Accounting.
                    I have worked for a consulting company and also in schools. I have been an active part of oragnizing community programs since I moved here.
                    I had taken technical training in Quality Assurance and SAS, but unfortunately couldnt finish because of my personal situation.
                    
                   <p> I love to travel with my family. I have visited most of the caribbean islands including Jamaica, US virgin Islands, St. Martin.
                    Dominican Republican, Bahamas. Bermuda was the last Island I visited with my family in 2016. 
                     Now, that I have taken up the Bootcamp course, I'm going to have to change my life style and 
                    spend more time learning and finishing up my assignments.

                    I would like to complete my Bootcamp for Full Stack Developer and find a job in the IT field. I understand that it needs immense effort, 
                    which I am willing to give. I have good support from instructors team, which is very important.
